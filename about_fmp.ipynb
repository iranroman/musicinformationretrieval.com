    "The book [*Fundamentals of Music Processing*](https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/fau/professor/mueller/bookFMP) (FMP)  is a textbook by [Meinard Müller](https://www.audiolabs-erlangen.de/fau/professor/mueller), a well-known and prolific researcher in MIR, and published by Springer in 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "For many years, the field of music information retrieval has suffered from a lack of consolidated texts which unify its many disparate topics. Until now, students and researchers have had to learn about MIR mostly by reading the original research papers -- a daunting task. FMP is perhaps the best attempt to address this issue. It is a self-contained textbook which covers many MIR tasks such as feature extraction, audio-to-score alignment, musical form and structure, chord recognition, beat tracking, fingerprinting, and source separation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We integrated content from FMP into musicinformationretrieval.com in 2016."
